First, install all python dependencies from requirements.txt

Then, Follow these instructions to generate bank ips

1) python bgp.py
**This will generate a file called bank_as.json**

2) Run bgp.py until you receive no more error warnings about daily limits being reached, take 24 hours between each run of this function
   Warning message will be of the form "XXX/XXX ASN ranges processed. Daily limit has reached, please run script again in 24 hours"

3) sudo python rdns.py bank_as.json
**This will take a long time to run. It also requires sudo privileges for port scanning.
This will generate a file called bank_as.json.dns**

4) python subd.py bank_as.json.dns bank_domains &> bank_subdomains
**bank_domains is the file of bank domain names that can be added to easily
This will take a long time to run as well**

5) python ip_gen.py bank_as.json.dns bank_subdomains &> bank_ips
**This will not take a long time at all**
